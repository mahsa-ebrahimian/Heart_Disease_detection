# Heart_Disease_detection
In this project we are going to predict heart disease problems.
Machine learning plays a vital role in the area therefore we have used 
various machine learning techniques such as Decision Tree, Naiive bayes, K nearest neighbors, random forest and support vector machine (SVM) are compared together and an Ensemble model is developed for more comprehensive comparison.
. Four datasets are used for this experiment. 
These records have categorical, integer, and numerical attribute values.
