# Heart_Disease_detection
In this project we are going to predict heart disease problems.
Machine learning plays a vital role in the area therefore we have used 
various machine learning techniques such as Decision Tree, Naiive bayes, K nearest neighbors, random forest and support vector machine (SVM)
. Cleveland.py is the implementation of these techniques using  Cleveland dataset which has 303 records. 
These records have categorical, integer, and numerical attribute values. This dataset contains 76 attributes in total, but only 14 attributes are used for the published experiments as they are considered directly related to heart disease.
