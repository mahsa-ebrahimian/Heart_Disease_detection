# Heart_Disease_detection
In this project we have used various datasets to predict heart disease problems.
First Dataset is Cleveland dataset with 303 records. 
These records have categorical, integer, and numerical attribute values. This dataset contains 76 attributes in total, but only 14 attributes are used for the published experiments as they are considered directly related to heart disease.
